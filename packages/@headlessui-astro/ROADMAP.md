# HeadlessUI Astro Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development steps for the HeadlessUI Astro package.

## Current Status

✅ Initial project structure established
✅ Core utilities for hydration strategies
✅ TypeScript type definitions for components
✅ Documentation and examples
✅ Menu component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Dialog component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Disclosure component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Listbox component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Combobox component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Tabs component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ RadioGroup component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Astro playground with component examples

## Architecture Evolution

The HeadlessUI Astro package has evolved from using Vue components as a foundation to having its own independent implementation:

- **Original Approach**: Initial implementation leveraged `@headlessui/vue` components
- **Current Approach**: Independent implementation with native TypeScript for complete Vue independence
  - Core utilities for state management
  - Focus management system
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Accessibility features
