# HeadlessUI Astro Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development steps for the HeadlessUI Astro package.

## Current Status

✅ Initial project structure established
✅ Core utilities for hydration strategies
✅ TypeScript type definitions for components
✅ Documentation and examples
✅ Menu component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Dialog component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Disclosure component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Listbox component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Combobox component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Tabs component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ RadioGroup component and subcomponents implemented (independent)
✅ Astro playground with component examples

## Architecture Evolution

The HeadlessUI Astro package has evolved from using Vue components as a foundation to having its own independent implementation:

- **Original Approach**: Initial implementation leveraged `@headlessui/vue` components
- **Current Approach**: Independent implementation with native TypeScript for complete Vue independence
  - Core utilities for state management
  - Focus management system
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Accessibility features

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete Core Components (Independent Implementation)

- [x] Dialog component
  - [x] Convert Dialog.astro from Vue-based to independent implementation
  - [x] Create dialog-client.ts for client-side functionality
  - [x] Implement DialogPanel.astro, DialogTitle.astro, DialogDescription.astro
  - [x] Create Dialog.load.astro (eager hydration variant)
  - [x] Implement focus trap functionality specific to Dialog

- [x] Disclosure component
  - [x] Disclosure.astro (independent implementation)
  - [x] DisclosureButton.astro
  - [x] DisclosurePanel.astro
  - [x] Disclosure.load.astro (eager hydration variant)

- [x] Listbox component
  - [x] Listbox.astro (independent implementation)
  - [x] ListboxButton.astro
  - [x] ListboxOptions.astro
  - [x] ListboxOption.astro
  - [x] ListboxLabel.astro
  - [x] Listbox.load.astro (eager hydration variant)

### Phase 2: Additional Components (Independent Implementation)

- [x] Combobox component
  - [x] Combobox.astro
  - [x] ComboboxInput.astro
  - [x] ComboboxButton.astro
  - [x] ComboboxOptions.astro
  - [x] ComboboxOption.astro
  - [x] ComboboxLabel.astro
  - [x] Combobox.load.astro (eager hydration variant)

- [x] Tabs component
  - [x] Tabs.astro
  - [x] TabGroup.astro
  - [x] TabList.astro
  - [x] Tab.astro
  - [x] TabPanels.astro
  - [x] TabPanel.astro

- [x] RadioGroup component
  - [x] RadioGroup.astro
  - [x] RadioGroupLabel.astro
  - [x] RadioGroupOption.astro
  - [x] RadioGroupDescription.astro

- [x] Switch component
  - [x] Switch.astro
  - [x] SwitchLabel.astro
  - [x] SwitchDescription.astro
  - [x] SwitchGroup.astro

- [ ] Popover component
  - [ ] Popover.astro
  - [ ] PopoverButton.astro
  - [ ] PopoverPanel.astro
  - [ ] PopoverGroup.astro

### Phase 3: Playground and Documentation

- [x] Create an Astro playground
  - [x] Set up playground directory structure
  - [x] Configure playground with Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Create basic layout and navigation
  - [x] Implement examples for Menu component
  - [x] Implement examples for Dialog component
  - [x] Implement examples for Disclosure component
  - [x] Implement examples for Listbox component
  - [x] Implement examples for Combobox component
  - [ ] Create complex pattern examples (combinations of components)

- [ ] Enhance documentation
  - [ ] API reference for each component
  - [ ] Migration guide from Vue/React to Astro
  - [ ] Performance considerations
  - [ ] Advanced usage examples
  - [ ] Update documentation to reflect independent implementation

### Phase 4: Testing

- [ ] Setup testing infrastructure
  - [ ] Configure Jest or Vitest for Astro components
  - [ ] Create test utilities for component testing
  - [ ] Implement accessibility testing

- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for core utilities
  - [ ] Component tests
  - [ ] Keyboard navigation tests
  - [ ] Accessibility tests

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize bundle size
  - [ ] Tree-shaking optimization
  - [ ] Code splitting for components
- [ ] Benchmark component performance
- [ ] Fine-tune hydration strategies
- [ ] Implement server-side rendering optimizations

## Future Considerations

- Advanced animations and transitions
- Server-side rendering optimizations
- Astro island architecture optimizations
- Integration with Astro View Transitions API
- Cross-framework interoperability (using Astro components with React/Vue islands)
