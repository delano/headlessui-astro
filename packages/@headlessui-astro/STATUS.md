# HeadlessUI Astro Implementation Status

## Current Status

We have successfully created the foundation for the HeadlessUI Astro package, which adapts HeadlessUI Vue components to work in Astro. The following has been accomplished:

### Project Structure

- Created a proper package structure for `@headlessui-astro`
- Set up TypeScript configuration
- Added utility modules for hydration strategies
- Created documentation and examples

### Components Implemented

1. **Menu Component**
   - Menu.astro and Menu.load.astro
   - MenuButton.astro
   - MenuItems.astro
   - MenuItem.astro

2. **Dialog Component**
   - Dialog.astro and Dialog.load.astro
   - DialogPanel.astro
   - DialogTitle.astro
   - DialogDescription.astro

### Documentation

- Created README with usage examples
- Added ROADMAP outlining implementation phases
- Created CONTRIBUTING guidelines
- Added examples demonstrating component usage

## Next Components to Implement

According to our roadmap, we should focus on implementing these components next:

1. **Disclosure Component**
   - Disclosure.astro
   - DisclosureButton.astro
   - DisclosurePanel.astro

2. **Listbox Component**
   - Listbox.astro
   - ListboxButton.astro
   - ListboxOptions.astro
   - ListboxOption.astro
   - ListboxLabel.astro

Following those, we'll move on to:
- Combobox
- RadioGroup
- Switch
- Tabs
- Popover

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Hydration Strategy**: Currently we're implementing separate component files for different hydration strategies (e.g., Menu.astro, Menu.load.astro). We should consider whether a more unified approach is possible in the future.

2. **Slot Handling**: Astro's slot system differs from Vue's, particularly with render props like `{({active}) => (...)}`. We've documented this in the compatibility guide, but it may need further refinement.

3. **Testing**: We need to establish a proper testing infrastructure to ensure component functionality.

4. **Build Process**: The build process is currently simple, using tsup. We may need to refine this as the project grows.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Disclosure component
2. Implement the Listbox component
3. Set up a basic testing environment
4. Create a more comprehensive examples repository
5. Plan for a beta release once all main components are implemented
