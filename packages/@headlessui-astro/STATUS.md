# HeadlessUI Astro Implementation Status

## Current Status

We have successfully created the foundation for the HeadlessUI Astro package, with significant architectural improvements to make it completely independent from Vue. The following has been accomplished:

### Project Structure

- Created a proper package structure for `@headlessui-astro`
- Set up TypeScript configuration
- Added core state management utilities
- Implemented keyboard handling system
- Created focus management system
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Enhanced hydration utilities with component-specific strategies

### Architectural Evolution

- **Initial Implementation**: Initially built by adapting `@headlessui/vue` components
- **Current Implementation**: Independently implemented with pure TypeScript, no Vue dependencies
  - Native state management system (see `src/core/state/state.ts`)
  - Custom keyboard event handling (see `src/core/keyboard/keyboard-handler.ts`)
  - Focus trap implementation (see `src/core/focus/focus-trap.ts`)
  - Component context management

### Components Implemented

1. **Menu Component (Independent Implementation)**
   - Menu.astro and Menu.load.astro
   - MenuButton.astro
   - MenuItems.astro
   - MenuItem.astro
   - Backed by menu-client.ts for client-side functionality

2. **Dialog Component (Independent Implementation)**
   - Dialog.astro and Dialog.load.astro

   - Backed by disclosure-client.ts for client-side functionality

4. **Listbox Component (Independent Implementation)**
   - Listbox.astro and Listbox.load.astro
   - ListboxButton.astro
   - ListboxOptions.astro
   - ListboxOption.astro
   - ListboxLabel.astro
   - Backed by listbox-client.ts for client-side functionality

5. **Combobox Component (Independent Implementation)**
   - Combobox.astro and Combobox.load.astro
   - ComboboxInput.astro
   - ComboboxButton.astro
   - ComboboxOptions.astro
   - ComboboxOption.astro
   - ComboboxLabel.astro
   - Backed by combobox-client.ts for client-side functionality

6. **Tabs Component (Independent Implementation)**
   - TabGroup.astro and TabGroup.load.astro
   - TabList.astro
   - Tab.astro
   - TabPanels.astro
   - TabPanel.astro
   - Backed by tabs-client.ts for client-side functionality

7. **RadioGroup Component (Independent Implementation)**
   - RadioGroup.astro and RadioGroup.load.astro
   - RadioGroupLabel.astro
   - RadioGroupOption.astro
   - RadioGroupDescription.astro
   - Backed by radiogroup-client.ts for client-side functionality

### Documentation

- Created README with usage examples
- Updated ROADMAP outlining implementation phases
- Created CONTRIBUTING guidelines
- Added detailed component usage examples
- Status documentation (this file)

### Playground

- Created Astro playground in `/playgrounds/astro/` directory
- Added examples for all implemented components
- Demonstrates real-world usage with Tailwind CSS
- Provides interactive testing environment

## Next Components to Implement (Independently)

According to our roadmap, we should focus on implementing these components next with native implementations (no Vue dependencies):

1. **Check what utils are needed**
   - keyboard (according to packages/@headlessui-astro/src/components/combobox/combobox-client.ts)
   - state
   - LIST THE REMAINING

2. **Switch Component**
   - Switch.astro (independent implementation)
   - SwitchGroup.astro
   - SwitchLabel.astro
   - SwitchDescription.astro

3. **Popover Component**
   - Popover.astro (independent implementation)
   - PopoverButton.astro
   - PopoverPanel.astro
   - PopoverGroup.astro

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Hydration Strategy**:
   - **Challenge**: Making components work efficiently with Astro's partial hydration model
   - **Solution**: Implemented separate component files for different hydration strategies (e.g., Menu.astro, Menu.load.astro)
   - **Enhanced**: Created a unified hydration utility system that adapts based on component type

2. **Focus Management**:
   - **Challenge**: Managing focus in partially hydrated components
   - **Solution**: Implemented standalone focus trap system in `src/core/focus/focus-trap.ts`
   - **Enhanced**: Dialog-specific focus trap implementation with body scroll locking and accessibility features

3. **State Management**:
   - **Challenge**: Creating a lightweight state system for components
   - **Solution**: Implemented a simple subscription-based state in `src/core/state/state.ts`
   - **Enhanced**: Component-specific state management with clean API

4. **Vue Independence**:
   - **Challenge**: Initially built on Vue, needed complete independence
   - **Solution**: Rewrote core functionality with pure TypeScript
   - **Progress**: All implemented components are now fully independent from Vue

5. **Testing**:
   - **Challenge**: Testing Astro components effectively
   - **Solution**: Planned testing infrastructure in Phase 3 of roadmap

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement Listbox component independently - Completed
2. ✅ Implement Combobox component independently - Completed
3. ✅ Set up an Astro playground - Completed
   - A playground has been created in `/playgrounds/astro/` to demonstrate and test components
   - This provides real-world usage examples and testing
4. ✅ Implement Tabs component independently - Completed
5. ✅ Implement RadioGroup component independently - Completed
6. Set up a testing infrastructure
7. Implement remaining components (Switch, Popover, etc.)

## Beta Release Timeline

We are targeting a beta release once all main components have been implemented independently, with a focus on these components for initial release:

- Menu (✅ Completed)
- Dialog (✅ Completed)
- Disclosure (✅ Completed)
- Listbox (✅ Completed)
- Combobox (✅ Completed)
- Tabs (✅ Completed)
- RadioGroup (✅ Completed)
- Switch (Next priority)

Each component will have comprehensive documentation, TypeScript type definitions, and proper accessibility support.
